						<h2>Teaching Philosophy and Experience</h2>
					</header>
						<p class="no-justify" style="color:#1c1e22;">My teaching is guided by three goals: creating inclusive learning environments, cultivating curiosity-driven engagement, and promoting lifelong growth through critical thinking and problem-solving. To achieve these goals, I use evidence-based practices such as pre-class surveys, inquiry-based assignments, and peer feedback. These methods allow me to adapt instruction to student needs, encourage active discussion, and connect molecular principles to real-world challenges.</p>
						<p class="no-justify" style="color:#1c1e22;">My teaching experience spans biology, chemistry, and bioinformatics courses, including advanced classes in chemical biology and bioinorganic chemistry, as well as guest lectures on DNA-based sensors, diagnostics, and scientific communication. I have also completed an Advanced Teaching Preparation Certificate and formal training in pedagogy, mentoring, and science communication. Beyond the classroom, I mentor students from high school through postdoctoral levels, supporting their growth into confident and independent scientists.</p>
					<header>
						<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Teaching Philosophy</h3>
						<p class="no-justify" style="color:#1c1e22;">I believe science is not a static set of facts but a process of exploration. My teaching is student-centered and inclusive, with a focus on curiosity, active learning, and research-based problem solving. My goal is to help students connect molecular principles to biomedical challenges and grow into confident, independent scientists.</p>
					</header>
					<header>
						<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Mentorship</h3>
						<p class="no-justify" style="color:#1c1e22;">I have mentored students at every level, from high school through postdoctoral training. My approach combines individualized development plans, scaffolded responsibilities, and consistent feedback.</p>
						<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Examples of mentoring outcomes</h4>
  							<ul>
								<li><h5>Postdoctoral Mentorship:</h5><p class="second-list" style="color:#1c1e22;">Advised postdoctoral fellows on project design and troubleshooting, providing guidance that strengthened their independence. Supported professional growth through discussions on research direction and career planning.</p></li>					
								<li><h5>Undergraduate Cohort Mentor:</h5><p class="second-list" style="color:#1c1e22;">Served as Class Teacher at Peking University for four years, providing academic and personal guidance.the class was recognized as an Outstanding Class at both the university and provincial levels.</p></li>

							</ul>
							<p class="no-justify" style="color:#1c1e22;">Most importantly, I have watched students grow in competence, confidence, and independence — progress that I find deeply rewarding as a mentor.</p>
							</ul>
					</header>
