				<h1>How can nucleic acids be engineered into versatile molecular tools for biology and medicine? </h1>
				<p>Accurately measuring metal ions in living systems has long been a challenge, as conventional probes often lack the specificity, stability, or compatibility required for in vivo studies, leaving many aspects of cellular chemistry inaccessible.</p>
				<p>To address this gap, I advanced DNAzyme- and aptamer-based sensors with fluorescence, bioluminescence, and BRET outputs, enabling applications across biology and medicine. These include excitation-free bioluminescent probes for monitoring metal flux in vivo (Angewandte Chemie, 2023), smartphone-readable sensors (Chem, 2023), and aptamer-based probes for ATP tracking in brain tissue and across the blood–brain barrier (JACS, 2025; ACS Central Science, 2024). Through collaborations, I further demonstrated the translational potential of these platforms by detecting lithium in bipolar patient–derived neurons (ACS Cent. Sci., 2021) and monitoring ionic flux in cancer models (JACS, 2025).</p>
				<p>Building on this foundation, my independent research program integrates chemistry and neuroscience to uncover how imbalances in metal ions and metabolites contribute to neurodegeneration. By resolving their roles in protein aggregation, propagation, and neuronal vulnerability, my work aims to define the microenvironmental interactions that determine pathological progression and neuronal death.</p>
