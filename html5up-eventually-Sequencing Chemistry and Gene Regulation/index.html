				<h1>How do metal ions influence gene expression in individual cells? </h1>
				<p>Single-cell sequencing has transformed biology by linking gene expression to cell identity and state. However, these approaches cannot simultaneously measure intracellular metal ion levels, leaving the role of metals in transcriptional regulation poorly defined.</p>
				<p>To bridge this gap, I co-developed sequencing platforms that integrate metal ion measurements into single-cell workflows and created computational pipelines to connect these chemical readouts with transcriptomes.</p>
				<p>Looking ahead, my independent program will adapt these strategies to study how redox imbalance shapes neuronal and glial states in the aging and diseased brain. By linking chemical changes to cell states, my goal is to reveal mechanisms of vulnerability and identify opportunities for intervention.</p>
